- Creating routes with react-router-DOM
- Context for state management
- Form validation with react-hook-form
- Redux for managing complex state

This project aims to develop a Pomodoro Timer application using JavaScript and TypeScript languages, built with the React framework. Below are the key topics that will be covered in the project:

### Managing libraries with npm
- Utilizing npm for managing project dependencies and packages.

### Styling with styled components
- Implementing styled components to style the user interface of the Pomodoro Timer application.

### React componentization
- Decomposing the application into reusable and manageable components to enhance maintainability and code organization.

### Creating routes with react-router-DOM
- Using react-router-DOM to create and manage routes for navigating between different pages of the Pomodoro Timer application.

### Context for state management
- Implementing context API for managing global state and sharing data across components efficiently.

### Form validation with react-hook-form
- Integrating react-hook-form library to facilitate form validation and improve user experience in handling input fields.

### Redux for managing complex state
- Incorporating Redux library for managing complex state and global data flow within the Pomodoro Timer application, providing a scalable solution for state management.

Through the exploration of these topics, the Pomodoro Timer project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of building React applications while addressing key aspects such as state management, styling, routing, and form handling.
